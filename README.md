[Charmed Blackbox Exporter (blackbox-exporter-k8s)][Blackbox Exporter operator] is a charm for
[Blackbox Exporter].

The charm imposes configurable resource limits on the workload, can be readily
integrated with [prometheus][Prometheus operator], [grafana][Grafana operator]
and [loki][Loki operator], and it comes with built-in alert rules and dashboards for
self-monitoring.

## Getting started

### Basic deployment

Once you have a controller and model ready, you can deploy the blackbox exporter
using the Juju CLI:

```shell
juju deploy --channel=beta blackbox-exporter-k8s
```

The available [channels](https://snapcraft.io/docs/channels) are listed at the top
of [the page](https://charmhub.io/blackbox-exporter-k8s) and can also be retrieved with
Charmcraft CLI:

```shell
$ charmcraft status blackbox-exporter-k8s

Track    Base                  Channel    Version    Revision    Resources
latest   ubuntu 22.04 (amd64)  stable     -          -           -
                               candidate  -          -           -
                               beta       1          1           blackbox-exporter-image (r1)
                               edge       1          1           blackbox-exporter-image (r1)
```

Once the Charmed Operator is deployed, the status can be checked by running:

```shell
juju status --relations --storage --color
```


### Configuration

In order to configure the Blackbox Exporter, a [configuration file](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md)
should be provided using the
[`config_file`](https://charmhub.io/blackbox-exporter-k8s/configure#config_file) option:

```shell
juju config blackbox-exporter-k8s \
  config_file='@path/to/blackbox.yml'
```

To verify Blackbox Exporter is using the expected configuration you can use the
[`show-config`](https://charmhub.io/blackbox-exporter-k8s/actions#show-config) action:

```shell
juju run-action blackbox-exporter-k8s/0 show-config --wait
```

To configure the actual probes, there first needs to be a Prometheus relation:

```shell
juju relate blackbox-exporter-k8s prometheus
```

Then, the probes configuration should be written to a file (following the 
[Blackbox Exporter docs](https://github.com/prometheus/blackbox_exporter#prometheus-configuration)
) and passed via `juju config`:

```shell
juju config blackbox-exporter-k8s \
  probes_file='@path/to/probes.yml'
```

Note that the `relabel_configs` of each scrape job doesn't need to be specified, and will be 
overridden by the charm with the needed labels and the correct Blackbox Exporter url.

## OCI Images
